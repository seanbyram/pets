    <h2>Isabelle</h2>
    <p>
      When we got Isabelle the paperwork stated she was a dachshund/terrier mix. However after living with her for awhile I believe she is actually a Chihuahua/Rat Terrir mix
    </p>

    <p>Some of Isabelle's favorite activities are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cuddling</li>
      <li>Yelling</li>
      <li>Chewing</li>
    </ul>
